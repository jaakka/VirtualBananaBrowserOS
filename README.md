You log into the system with your phone by reading the qr code at the beginning. after that, the desktop files are retrieved from the database.

There was a small design error in the calculator. For some reason, I assumed that the order of operations was not calculated in the correct sequence, so I had to rearrange the numbers a bit, but this actually facilitated other design aspects. The calculator still does not support nested or parenthesized calculations.
